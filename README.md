This is my first Ruby on Rails project. Just a simple blog.
The technical specification for it:
• A user is able to log in and sign up;
• A user is able to create, update, delete his blog;
• A blog can have posts on it.
• Posts in the blog can be added, deleted or updated only by blog owner. 


Technologies that I used:
• RBENV for ruby version managing;
• PostgreSQL for database;
• Devise for user authentication;
• Bootstrap 4 for better front-end creation;
• Heroku for production. Here is the link on working app: [the-blog] (https://the-blog-2.herokuapp.com). It could take some time to load, please wait.
