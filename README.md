# README


This is my first Ruby on Rails project. Just a simple blog.
The technical specification for it:
8
* A user is able to log in and sign up;
* A user is able to create, update, delete his blog;
* A blog can have posts on it.
* Posts in the blog can be added, deleted or updated only by blog owner. 


Technologies that I used:
* RBENV for ruby version managing;
* PostgreSQL for database;
* Devise for user authentication;
* Bootstrap 4 for better front-end creation;
* Heroku for production. Here is the link on working app: https://the-blog-2.herokuapp.com. It could take some time to load, please wait.
